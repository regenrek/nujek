Before you begin you need to **decide** if you want to use our starter template or start a storyblok project with nuxt from scratch.


<alert>Nujek requires Node.js >=12.0.0</alert>

## 1. Nuxt Storyblok Starter template

If you like to try out nujek and it's features and prefer a more out of the box solution then go for [nuxt-storyblok-starter](https://github.com/regenrek/nuxt-storyblok-starter) template.

## 2. Manual Setup

If you want to start your own template from scratch or you want to gain more control and know whats happen behind the scenes you can also look at the [manual install](/getting-started/manual-install) instructions.
