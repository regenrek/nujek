Where Storyblok is solving the content problem - Nujek is solving the hassle to setup your Nuxt.js Website with Storyblok to make setup a breeze.

## Why does this exist?

For every website we did we added new features to our stack until we formed it to a framework called 'Nujek'.

## How does Nujek help my workflow?

For every website you do you will need probabyl to care about the following tasks.

* Add and configure Storyblok API in your project.
With nujek you only need to your add your API in a secure `.env` file.


* Code components 
We have prepared some common components which are ready to use with
storyblok like [Image](#), [Section](#) and even powerful search and filterable [Grids](#).
And more to come...

* Connect and code components with
Storyblok as it names say works with bloks. So you build your landingpages
as blocks within a loop. We have prepared a visual setup so you just have
to build these blocks in form of a vue component. As easy it is.

* Even more
Nujek is just a module for nuxt which doesn't change anything in core so that means
you basically have a nuxt project. So power it up with more modules, plugins or whatever
you like. Include it in your own starter project. Everything is possible. We have
prepared some tutorials to see how you can gain more

* Track websites user with Analytics.
* Vue Cookie Law for GDPR.
