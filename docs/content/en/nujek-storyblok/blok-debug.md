Blok components are used for storyblok dynamic bloks functionality. If you define a blok component in storyblok it will magically search for a related component in this folder and display it. We're using the `@nuxtjs/components`[Dynamic Components](https://github.com/nuxt/components#dynamic-components) feature.


`<BlokDebug>` is used internally by `@nujek/storyblok` module. It shows the current storyblok blok response to help developers how to integrate it correctly.
